                <p>The player with the black pieces moves first, then players alternate until one of them has no more moves available to play, wether because none of his pieces have legal moves available to make, or he doesn't have any pieces at all.</p>
                <p>To play, a player must first select one of his pieces, then all of that piece's legal moves will be shown as red rectangles on the board. To move the piece, simply click where you want it to be.</p>
                <p>The players will then take turns moving their pieces through the board, until one of them has no more available legal moves (all his pieces are stuck), or he does not have any more pieces to play with. That player loses the game.</p>
                <p>A piece making a non-capturing move (not involving a jump) may move only one square forward, diagonally.</p>
                <p>If a player is able to make a capture, there is no option; the jump must be made. If more than one capture is available, the player is free to choose whichever he or she prefers</p>
                <p>If a capture sets up the player for another capture with that piece, he must make that jump on the same turn.</p>
                <p>When a piece is at the furthest row from the player that controls that piece at the end of his turn, that piece is crowned and becomes a king.</p>
                <p>Kings can move one square both forwards and backwards, diagonally.</p>
